# Quiz Application

This project is a Quiz Application built with React and TypeScript, designed as part of an assignment for BrightChamps. The application allows users to attempt multiple-choice quizzes, track their score, and see their result at the end of the quiz. The project has been deployed on Netlify and can be run locally for development purposes.

## Features

- Users can navigate through a set of quiz questions.
- Multiple-choice answers are provided, and users can select an option.
- The app keeps track of the userâ€™s progress and score as they answer questions.
- The final result is displayed with the total score at the end of the quiz.
- The user can retake the quiz or start a new quiz.
- Points are awarded or deducted based on the correct or incorrect answers.

## How Points Are Calculated

- **Correct Answer:** 1 point is awarded for each correct answer.
- **Incorrect Answer:** 1 point is deducted for each wrong answer (with a minimum score of 0 points).
- **No Negative Scores:** If a user answers a question incorrectly, the score is not deducted.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - If a user answers a **fresh** question correctly, the score is increased by 1 point.
> - If a user answers a **fresh** question incorrectly, the score is not deducted.
> - If a user changes their answer from correctly answered to incorrectly answered, the score is deducted.
> - If a user changes their answer from incorrectly answered to correctly answered, the score increases by 1 point.
> - If a user changes their answer from incorrectly answered to incorrectly answered, the score is not deducted.
